## 2026-03-31 - Redacting Dynamic Application API Keys in Error Logs
**Vulnerability:** Dynamic API key tokens (`sk_live_...` and `sk_test_...`) created at runtime and stored hashed in PostgreSQL were not redacted by `sanitize_error_message()` when formatted as standalone tokens or within unhandled exception strings, leaking secrets to persistent logs and job error fields.
**Learning:** Env-var based secret redaction and header-based regexes miss application-specific bearer/API tokens when tokens are passed or printed without standard `Authorization: Bearer` or `api_key=` prefixes.
**Prevention:** Include token format regexes (such as `\bsk_(?:live|test)_[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\b`) directly in centralized log sanitization routines.

## 2026-03-31 - Redacting JSON-Encoded Bearer Tokens in Error Sanitization
**Vulnerability:** Legacy bearer tokens stored as JSON object maps in environment variables (such as `RPY_BEARER_TOKENS`) were not extracted as individual secrets during log sanitization, leaking bearer credentials when referenced standalone in error logs or job exceptions.
**Learning:** Checking raw environment variable values as strings misses individual secret credentials embedded inside structured JSON environment variables.
**Prevention:** Parse structured JSON environment variables in secret collection routines to extract individual credential keys for redaction.

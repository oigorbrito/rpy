# Embedding-space rollout

Rpy is migrating vector retrieval from the legacy OpenAI `process_steps.embedding vector(1536)` column to provider/model-isolated `process_step_embeddings vector(1024)` rows.

## Deployment switch

`EMBEDDING_SPACE_RUNTIME_ENABLED=false` is the compatibility/rollback mode. It preserves the historical OpenAI path and does not read or write the new embedding table.

`EMBEDDING_SPACE_RUNTIME_ENABLED=true` enables the provider/model-isolated runtime. The active space is resolved by `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` and supports exactly one provider per deployment.

### BGE-M3

BGE is the default self-hosted provider:

- `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=bge`;
- model `BAAI/bge-m3`;
- 1024 dimensions;
- `BGE_EMBEDDING_PATH` points to the pre-provisioned local artifact;
- optional `BGE_EMBEDDING_DEVICE`;
- optional `BGE_EMBEDDING_USE_FP16`.

The deployment must use the BGE-capable image/artifact contract documented in `docs/deployment/bge-image.md`. CI does not download the model. Building a BGE-capable image alone is not rollout evidence: the historical reindex and real retrieval-quality evaluation remain separate gates.

### Cohere Embed v4

Cohere is implemented as an optional external provider:

- `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=cohere`;
- `ALLOW_EXTERNAL_EMBEDDINGS=true` is mandatory;
- model `embed-v4.0`;
- 1024 dimensions;
- `COHERE_API_KEY` is worker-only;
- no automatic fallback to BGE, OpenAI or another provider.

External authorization is environment-specific and does not override secrecy. See `docs/engineering/external-embedding-authorization.md`.

## Reindex behavior

On a long-process vector retrieval with the new runtime enabled, Rpy:

1. finds movements for the requested version that do not have a vector in the exact active provider/model space;
2. encodes only those missing movements;
3. upserts rows in `process_step_embeddings` keyed by `step_id + provider + model`;
4. encodes the query in that same active semantic space;
5. searches only rows matching the exact provider/model space.

Existing vectors from other spaces remain untouched for controlled rollback or later deletion. They are never mixed in one ranking.

Historical reindexing follows the same provider/model isolation. Cohere reindexing excludes secret process versions, and the embedding runtime independently rejects external embedding of a secret version before movement text is sent to the provider.

## Rollback

To roll back during migration, disable `EMBEDDING_SPACE_RUNTIME_ENABLED` and keep the existing OpenAI configuration. The legacy `process_steps.embedding` column remains unchanged by the new runtime.

Do not switch provider/model by editing rows in place. A provider/model change requires re-embedding into its own space and validation before the deployment switch changes. Removing Cohere authorization means disabling `ALLOW_EXTERNAL_EMBEDDINGS` or selecting an approved BGE/legacy rollback path and performing the corresponding controlled reindex/rollback procedure.

## Secrecy and external providers

Embedding-provider authorization does not override process secrecy rules.

- secret process versions are never sent to Cohere;
- the normal RAG path short-circuits secret processes;
- historical Cohere reindex excludes secret versions;
- the runtime independently refuses external embedding for a secret version;
- Cohere is never an automatic fallback;
- automated tests use fake/local encoders and make no paid-provider calls.

# Public API v1 contract

The `/v1` surface is the durable public contract for summary requests. Internal PostgreSQL queue job IDs are never exposed as public job identifiers.

## Authentication and authorization

Both legacy Bearer credentials and tenant API keys remain supported during migration. API keys are authenticated, rate-limited, and authorized against the requested CNJ before process data or provider-backed acquisition can run.

`GET /v1/resumos/{job_id}` first resolves the job inside the authenticated tenant, returning `404` for another tenant, then applies the API-key CNJ scope associated with that public job. This prevents job-ID enumeration from becoming a cross-tenant existence oracle.

## Routes

### `POST /v1/resumos`

Creates or replays one public summary request.

Requirements:

- `Authorization: Bearer ...`;
- `Idempotency-Key` header;
- JSON object containing `cnj`.

The normalized request body is fingerprinted. Reusing the same key and payload returns the same `job_id` without duplicating the Judit acquisition. Reusing the key with a different normalized payload returns `409`.

Response fields include:

- `job_id`;
- `poll_url`;
- `status`;
- `cnj`;
- `source_updated_at`;
- `sources`;
- `usage`;
- `flags`;
- `validation`;
- `iaSummary`;
- `error_code`.

A newly accepted request normally starts as `queued` and returns HTTP `202`.

### `GET /v1/resumos/{job_id}`

Returns the durable public lifecycle and, when available, the validated summary result. The public lifecycle is:

`queued → fetching → indexing → generating → validating → completed`

Terminal states are:

- `failed`;
- `source_unavailable`;
- `secrecy_blocked`;
- `validation_failed`.

Retries and stale-job reclaim cannot move a request backwards from a later or terminal state.

### `GET /v1/processos/{cnj}/resumo`

Returns only the latest tenant-authorized summary for the current process version whose persisted validation has `passed=true`. Invalid generated output is never published through this route.

### `GET /v1/processos/{cnj}/fontes`

Returns authorized, sanitized provenance for the current version. The response deliberately excludes `process_versions.source_payload`, Judit raw payloads, provider credentials, prompts, and raw external request identifiers.

The `sources` list contains:

- a sanitized `judit_lawsuit` version marker (`source_version`, cache flag and finalization timestamp);
- normalized movement provenance (`step_number`, optional `source_step_number`, date and title).

Movement text is not part of this provenance response. Secret processes already have no normalized/indexed movements under the ingestion secrecy boundary.

## Usage and validation

When a valid summary exists, `usage` exposes only local persisted generation metadata (`model`, `prompt_version`, `generation_ms`). Token accounting is not fabricated when it is not persisted.

`validation` is the persisted post-generation validation envelope. `iaSummary` is populated only when that validation passed.

## Health and metrics equivalence

- `/health` and `/healthz` are equivalent liveness probes;
- `/ready` and `/readyz` are equivalent PostgreSQL-backed readiness probes;
- `/ops/metrics` is the existing protected metrics surface and is the documented equivalent of a generic `/metrics` route for this release. It remains guarded by `RPY_OPS_TOKEN` rather than being exposed publicly.

## Provider behavior in tests

API/PostgreSQL contract tests do not require real Judit, Anthropic or OpenAI calls. Creation only enqueues the existing acquisition task; completed-response fixtures use synthetic persisted data or fake/local provider behavior.

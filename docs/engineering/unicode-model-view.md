# Unicode model-view security

Rpy preserves judicial source evidence and derives a separate model-facing representation for retrieval models, rerankers and summary generation. The source text stored in PostgreSQL is never rewritten merely to make model input safer.

## Threat model

Unicode can hide or visually disguise instructions through bidirectional controls, zero-width/default-ignorable characters and mixed-script homoglyphs. Unicode Technical Standard #39 (UTS #39), *Unicode Security Mechanisms*, provides mechanisms for detecting these classes of security problems.

Rpy does **not** claim full UTS #39 identifier-profile or confusable-skeleton conformance. Judicial prose is general text, not an identifier namespace, and UTS #39 explicitly warns that confusable skeletons are for internal comparison rather than display/normalization. Instead, Rpy uses a documented conservative model-input profile:

- normalize model input to NFC for canonical equivalence;
- flag and visibly expand Unicode format/default-ignorable characters;
- separately flag bidi controls and common zero-width controls;
- detect tokens that mix letters from the explicitly supported Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Hebrew and Arabic script ranges, and visibly expand the cross-script characters;
- leave ordinary Portuguese accents and single-script prose unchanged.

The model view is versioned as `unicode-model-view-v1`.

## Provenance and privacy

Movement provenance stores only a SHA-256 of the NFC-normalized original movement text plus the closed set of Unicode security flag names. Attachment provenance already stores the original chunk SHA-256 and now also stores the same flag names. The summary row stores the aggregate flags observed across the provider payload.

No Unicode flag contains source text, code-point positions, party names, prompt contents or document excerpts. Logs must not add those values.

## False positives

Mixed-script detection is deliberately narrow and policy-driven. The supported script policy is Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Hebrew and Arabic. Classification uses explicit Unicode code-point ranges in `app/unicode_security.py`; it does not infer arbitrary scripts from Unicode character names and does not claim complete Unicode Script-property coverage. Common/inherited characters are ignored unless they are alphabetic characters inside one of the listed ranges.

Single-script prose in any supported script is not rewritten, and multilingual prose is not marked merely because adjacent tokens use different supported scripts. Only one token containing letters from multiple supported scripts receives the `mixed_script` signal. A legitimate mixed-script legal identifier or party name may therefore be marked; the original evidence remains unchanged and auditable, while the model receives an explicit code-point marker.

Default-ignorable handling is intentionally conservative for model input. If a future legal corpus demonstrates a legitimate need for a currently exposed character, change the model-view profile with a regression fixture rather than mutating stored evidence.
